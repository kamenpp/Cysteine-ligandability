# Cysteine-ligandability

Using code with small modifications from https://github.com/Brian-hongyan/DeepCoSI from the paper by Du et al. "Proteome-Wide Profiling of the Covalent-Druggable Cysteines with a Structure-Based Deep Graph Learning Network" doi: 10.34133/2022/9873564

Human Proteome AF dataset used for creating the binding pockets (environments of cysteines): https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/alphafold/latest/UP000005640_9606_HUMAN_v4.tar

The file hct116_iwthout_CR.csv comes from the study by Kuljanin et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-00778-3  -> it is just modified to suit the objective of classification
And for the cheminformatics analysis of compounds thea again the data by Kuljanin et al. https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41587-020-00778-3/MediaObjects/41587_2020_778_MOESM7_ESM.xlsx is used
